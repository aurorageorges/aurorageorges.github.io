  <p class="paragraph">
    Hello, my name is Aurora Georges and I'm a Norwegian artist and illustrator 
    currently based in Vietnam.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph">
    Born in 1994, I early discovered a passion for drawing. While specializing 
    in art in high school, I knew I wanted to become better in what I love to 
    do. After obtaining my bachelor degree in Digital Art and Design from 
    Hedmark University of Applied Sciences, I started my career working as a 
    freelancer; creating illustrated logos and portraits.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph">  
    Currently I'm working as a Junior 2D concept artist for Gameloft in Da Nang 
    and it has been quite an adventure so far! I've been learning to produce 
    more efficiently concept art and illustrations in an overall production 
    process based on communication. Working abroad has also allowed me to 
    experience a new culture as well as an international working environment.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph">
    I'm always looking forward to meet new people and constantly improve my art, 
    so please feel free to contact me about work opportunities.
