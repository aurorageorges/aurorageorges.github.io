        Hello, my name is Aurora Georges and I'm a norwegian artist and illustrator 
        currently based in Vietnam! Born in 1994, I grew up with a big interest for 
        drawing and after finishing high school with a specialization within art, there 
        was no doubt. I wanted to become better in what I love to do, and so I got my 
        bachelor degree in Digital Art and Design after graduating from Hedmark 
        University of Applied Sciences. I started my career working as a freelancer 
        for Prouder AS creating illustrated logos for half a year before moving to 
        Vietnam.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">
        There I have been working for over a year as a Junior 2D concept artist for 
        Gameloft in Da Nang, and it has been quite the adventure so far! I've been 
        learning everything from how a normal workday look like at a game-company to 
        producing more efficiently concept art and illustrations after feedback.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph">  
        I'm always looking forward to meet new people and constantly improve my art, 
        so please feel free to contact me about exciting work opportunities!
