  <p class="paragraph">
    Hello, my name is Aurora Georges and I'm a norwegian artist and illustrator 
    currently based in Vietnam! Born in 1994, I grew up with a big interest for 
    drawing and after finishing high school with a specialization within art, there 
    was no doubt. I wanted to become better in what I love to do, and so I got my 
    bachelor degree in Digital Art and Design after graduating from Hedmark 
    University of Applied Sciences. I started my career working as a freelancer 
    for Prouder AS creating illustrated logos for half a year before moving to 
    Vietnam.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph">
    There I have been working for over a year as a Junior 2D concept artist for 
    Gameloft in Da Nang, and it has been quite the adventure so far! I've been 
    learning everything from how a normal workday look like at a game-company to 
    producing more efficiently concept art and illustrations after feedback.
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph">  
    I'm always looking forward to meet new people and constantly improve my art, 
    so please feel free to contact me about exciting work opportunities!
